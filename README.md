Compose2 started as a difference engine. It aims to describe abstractly differences in any type objects and implement basic algorithms for difference creation, validation, and to apply, manipulate, persist, etc. changes to objects. Two applications in mind to illustrate the change engine are:

1. A musical structure representation language
2. A file and directory versioning program/version control system.

The project aims to define a small language to describe change functions. As such a parser, etc. is implemented. The parser is also implemented in JavaScript.

A GUI is also devised to explain and facilitate performing the various manipulations with changes visually.
